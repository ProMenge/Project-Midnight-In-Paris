                    <p class="text sombraTexto">Owen Wilson plays Gil Pender, a screenwriter and aspiring novelist who
                        is deeply
                        nostalgic for
                        the Paris of the 1920s. He is enchanted by the city's historical charm and is in search of
                        inspiration for his first novel. Gil's romantic idealism and yearning for a different time
                        period are central to his character's journey as he navigates through the cultural and artistic
                        wonders of the past while questioning his present life choices and relationship.</p>

                    <p class="text sombraTexto">Rachel McAdams portrays Inez, Gil's pragmatic and materialistic fiancée.
                        Unlike Gil,
                        Inez is not
                        captivated by the allure of Paris's historical and cultural past. She prefers the comforts of
                        modern life and is more interested in social status and material wealth. Her character often
                        clashes with Gil's romantic and idealistic notions, providing a stark contrast that highlights
                        the differences in their worldviews and aspirations.</p>

                    <p class="text sombraTexto">Marion Cotillard plays Adriana, a beautiful and mysterious muse from the
                        1920s who
                        becomes
                        romantically involved with several prominent artists of the era. She embodies the glamorous and
                        artistic spirit of the time, and her relationships with various creative figures highlight her
                        allure and influence. Adriana's character represents the idealized past that Gil longs for, and
                        her presence in his life brings both inspiration and complications as he grapples with his
                        desires and the realities of his own time.</p>

                    <p class="text sombraTexto">Corey Stoll takes on the role of Ernest Hemingway, the iconic American
                        writer known
                        for his
                        direct writing style and adventurous spirit. Hemingway becomes a mentor figure to Gil, offering
                        him advice on writing, life, and love. Through his interactions with Hemingway, Gil gains
                        valuable insights and begins to understand the importance of living passionately and
                        authentically. Hemingway's larger-than-life personality and wisdom play a crucial role in
                        shaping Gil's journey and self-discovery.</p>
